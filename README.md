# 🌳 Soil Quality Monitoring System

Focused on develop my skills and understanding of object-oriented programing, modular design, and real-world data analysis usinng Java, I made this project simulates IoT-based agricultural sensors to track soil moisture and pH levels, providing farmers with instant insights for better crop management.

## 📝 Project Overview

The system functions as a real-time monitoring application that continuously collects soil data from simulated IoT sensors. It reads key environmental parameters such as soil moisture and pH levels, then processes this information through an analyzer module to generate actionable insights for farmers. The results are displayed live in the console, indicating whether the soil is too dry, too wet, acidic, or optimal for crop growth. Designed with a modular architecture, the project allows easy integration with actual hardware sensors, databases, or cloud dashboards for future expansion into a full smart agriculture platform.
